Explaining Money Like a Human — Transforming Jargon into Stories Clients Never Forget
 
Imagine navigating the complex world of financial advice with clarity, bypassing the technical jargon to focus on what genuinely matters to your clients. This book is your map, turning client conversations from intimidating technical discussions into journeys of understanding and connection.
Welcome to the intriguing realm of financial storytelling—a place where transformative client relationships await those ready to master the art of narrative. This guide equips both newly qualified and experienced financial advisers with the tools needed to excel beyond the numbers.
Our individual approaches as advisers can sometimes limit our communication. We become experts in products, calculations, and regulations—but remember, our technical expertise is just one element in the vast landscape of client experience. While professional knowledge forms the foundation of our service, it's essential to see the bigger picture: clients make decisions based on stories they can see themselves in, not spreadsheets they can barely decipher. True advisory wisdom comes from acknowledging this reality and seeing beyond the confines of financial terminology.
From ancient merchants sharing tales of trade routes to today's most successful advisers crafting compelling narratives about financial security, our inherent desire has always been to connect through story. This isn't just about explaining concepts; it's a journey towards creating understanding, trust, and a vision of a secure tomorrow that resonates on a human level.
The power of narrative, highlighted in studies across behavioural economics and psychology, is the cornerstone of exceptional financial advice. Consider the famous "elevator pitch" concept—in those brief moments, it's never the technical details that persuade, but the story that creates meaning. Similarly, your ability to transform complex financial strategies into compelling narratives isn't about simplifying information; it's about fulfilling your clients' psychological need for clarity and purpose.
For most clients, financial planning transcends the mere accumulation of wealth. It's the peace stemming from knowing their future is secure. Amidst the jargon and intricacies of financial markets, their predominant concern is not understanding every technical detail—it's the fear of making mistakes, missing opportunities, or running out of money. Beyond the complexities, people merely seek assurance for their and their families' futures, told in language that resonates with their lived experience.
By understanding the motivations that drive your clients and sidestepping the common communication pitfalls, you don't just aim for technical accuracy but align your advice with your clients' core desires and fears.
This book dispels myths clouding effective client communication and introduces core storytelling concepts like emotion, metaphor, timing, and relatable characters. You'll learn about human behaviour's impact on financial choices and how to craft narratives that align with long-term goals while addressing immediate concerns. You'll discover how different generations—from Baby Boomers to Generation Z—respond to stories through their unique cultural and experiential lenses, and how to adapt your narrative approach accordingly.
While foundational principles are discussed, remember that storytelling, like financial advice itself, is deeply personal. It requires adapting strategies to individual clients, their unique circumstances, and their personal goals. Developing your storytelling ability is also a lifelong learning process. Armed with the strategies and insights from this book, you'll stay grounded amidst the industry's push for more products and solutions, focusing instead on the human connection that truly drives client decisions.
Throughout, I share insights from my own journey working with financial advisers and their transformations through storytelling. But while this guide provides a comprehensive approach, it isn't a universal script. Your relationship with each client is unique. The stories you craft must reflect both your authentic voice and your client's individual narrative.
When clients walk into your office, they often can’t wait to discuss their pension options, ISAs, or money they’ve inherited. That’s completely natural. They’ve brought their statements, rehearsed their questions, and feel a responsibility to lay everything on the table. But in these moments, your job isn’t to jump straight into the numbers — it’s to help them take a breath, slow things down, and gently take control of the meeting. 

Guide the conversation back to the person, not the paperwork. Before you give any answers, you need to understand the journey that brought them here. That’s the part they don’t always realise they’re ready to share — but it’s where everything meaningful begins.

Where the Story Truly Begins
Before you share your advice, listen to their story.
Storytelling is a two-way street. Before we ever share our insights or offer guidance, we must first listen—truly listen—to our client's story. Who are they? Where have they come from? What moments have shaped them? It's in these personal narratives that the real work begins.
Clients like to tell their story—not just because it's cathartic, but because it helps them feel seen and valued. In a world that often rushes to offer solutions, being invited to share who they are and how they got here builds a rare kind of trust. It also gives advisers something more powerful than a fact-find ever could: context, emotion, and connection.
Too often, discovery meetings dive straight into financial concerns—budgets, pensions, fears about running out of money. But this approach can unintentionally trigger what psychologists call the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA)—a state of stress and anxiety linked to problem-solving, risk aversion, and fear.
Consider John, who arrived at my office requesting "retirement planning." His body language spoke volumes—shoulders tensed, answers clipped, enthusiasm nowhere to be found. Rather than pulling out calculators or pension projections, I asked about his journey. It turned out John had poured 40 years into building a small manufacturing business. What the numbers couldn't reveal was that this wasn't just his livelihood, it was his community, his purpose, his very identity.
When he shared stories about mentoring young employees and solving unique production challenges, his entire demeanour changed. His eyes brightened, his posture relaxed, and suddenly we were having a completely different conversation. What he actually needed wasn't a standard retirement plan, but a transition strategy that kept him connected to the business while gradually stepping back. By hearing his story first, we designed a phased exit that protected his financial needs while preserving the aspects of work that gave his life meaning.
Or take David, who described himself as "extremely conservative" with investments. On paper, his caution seemed oddly misaligned with his successful career launching startups. The disconnect made sense only after he shared his childhood story of watching his parents lose everything in a financial crisis.
Rather than pushing him toward investments that matched his entrepreneurial profile, I acknowledged his lived experience. We developed a dual-track approach: a rock-solid secure foundation that addressed his emotional need for safety, alongside a smaller allocation for growth opportunities that honoured his business instincts. By respecting the story behind his risk aversion, we created a plan he could follow instead of one he would abandon at the first market downturn.
These examples highlight why we should begin by asking about the person behind the numbers. Invite them to explore the life they'd love to live. What does fulfilment look like to them? What hopes and dreams still feel possible?
This shift activates what behavioural experts call the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA)—a more open, hopeful state of mind where clients feel energised, engaged, and optimistic. And as they begin to feel safe, heard, and inspired, something remarkable happens: the foundation for real, lasting financial planning is built.
So, before you ever open a spreadsheet or talk about risk, open the floor to their story. Let them feel seen. Let them feel heard. That's where the best financial journeys begin—and where your story, as their trusted adviser, truly starts.
