I'm creating a premium website for my book titled *The Art of Storytelling for Financial Advisers* by Mike LeGassick. This is not a typical author website — it must look and feel as if it were produced with a £100,000 design budget. 

The tone is professional, polished, intelligent, and modern — yet warm and relatable. This book is aimed at UK-based financial advisers and professionals. Please use UK spelling throughout (e.g., “behaviour”, “specialise”, “organise”, “realise”) and do not use Americanisms like “center”, “analyze”, or the US $ symbol.

🎯 **Website Purpose:**
- To promote the book
- Share Mike’s story and mission
- Showcase endorsements from respected UK voices
- Collect email signups
- Encourage visitors to buy the book via Amazon or another link
